## 📊 About the project

This dashboard was created by **Victor Alvarez Melendez**, Master’s student in Hydrogen Technology at **Technische Hochschule Rosenheim – Campus Burghausen**, to analyze the energy needs, fuel consumption, and autonomy of a campervan using a DMFC and lithium battery setup.

The main dashboard was built in **Python using Streamlit**, and this repository wraps it in a mobile-friendly PWA experience.

> Ideal for campers, engineers, researchers, or outdoor energy system planners.
